To play the game locally open two instances of the game.
In the first one click host. Then, in the same instance type name "client 1" (or some other name), and click join.
In the second instance type name "client 2"(or some other name) and click join. Now, the 
main game window of client 1 should open. THE GAME HAS NOT STARTED YET. To start the click
in the top bar on "game" and then "start game". The game will start. The yellow "<" next to the
"BATTLESHIPS" label is the turn indicator.
<br>
An attack is made by clicking a field on the right "water"-screen.
<br>
Orange "X" means hit.<br>
White "O" means miss.  
The color of a ship means destroyed.
<br>
<br>
To play "as" a Computer just use "Computer" as a name for the client. "Computer2" also works. By having
two clients named "Computer" and "Computer2" an exiting game between two computer players can be watched.
**Note**: The game still needs to be started manually 
<br>
<br>
To run the JUnit test go to the src/Tests/ directory and run them.
