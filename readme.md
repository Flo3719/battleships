## BATTLESHIPS
### by Florian and Koen

To start the game run the **main.java** file. 
<br>
<br>
**JavaFX must be properly setup in order to run the game**
<br>
<br>
#### To play the game locally open three instances of the application.
**In the first one** click host. This one is now the server. Optionally a custom port can be entered.
<br><br>
**In the second one** type name "client 1" (or some other name), and click join. You can also enter an IP and port before joining. by default
localhost and port 4242 are used.
<br>
<br>
**In the third** do the same as in the second one, but choose a different name.
<br>
<br>
Now, the main game window of client 1 should open as the two clients are assigned to a game by the server. THE GAME HAS NOT STARTED YET. To start, click
in the top bar on "Game" and then "start game". The game will start. The yellow "<" and ">" next to the
"BATTLESHIPS" label are the turn indicators.
<br>
An attack is made by clicking a field on the right "water"-screen.
<br>
Orange "X" means hit.<br>
White "O" means miss.<br>
The color of a ship means destroyed.
<br>
<br>
To play "as" a Computer just use "Computer" as a name for the client. "Computer2" also works. By having
two clients named "Computer" and "Computer2" an exiting game between two computer players can be watched.
**Note**: The game still needs to be started manually 
<br>
<br>
To run the JUnit test go to the src/Tests/ directory and run them.
